[Bezier Games](https://beziergames.com/). This is an unofficial fan project written as a fun learning project, and is not endorsed by the designer nor publisher.

# Built with React and socket.io
The code is split in two locations for the server and the client. Server code is located at `/onuw-server`, while client code is located at `/onuw-client`.

Backend is written with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [socket.io](https://socket.io/) to handle realtime communication between clients and the server.

Frontend is written with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) to manage state between components.

Both applications are deployed using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

# TODO:
There are many additional features I would like to add in the future.

- [ ] Use socket.io rooms and namespaces to allow for multiple games to be played at the same time
- [ ] Refractor code for Doppleganger role to be playable
